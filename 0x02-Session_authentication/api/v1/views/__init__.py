This module contains the blueprint for the API views.

It defines the `app_views` blueprint object, which is used
to group related API endpoints. The blueprint is registered
with the Flask application and has a URL prefix of '/api/v1'.

The module also imports the necessary views for the API
endpoints and loads user data from a file.
